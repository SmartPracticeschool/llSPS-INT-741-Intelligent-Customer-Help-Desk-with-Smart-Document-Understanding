Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
A typical customer care chatbot that can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
In this project, there will is an another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application passes the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” it will return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems.
To take it a step further, the project also uses the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This improved the answers returned from the queries
